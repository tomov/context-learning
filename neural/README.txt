    Discussion: on "sick" trials, the sick face shows up on the right side of the screen; on "not sick" trials, the happy face shows up on the left;
                otherwise the trials are identical => maybe that accounts for it?

Model 2 is wrong; was supposed to be the M2 posterior @ feedback (outcome) time but have extra regressors for the test trials that mess things up--

Model 3 is wrong; it had a pmod = 1 if the response was correct, 0 if not @ feedback (outcome) time

Model 4 is wrong; it had a prediction error pmod but it was calculated incorrectly

Model 7 is wrong; it is the choice probability pmod

Models 11, 12, 13 are for Momchil's own entertainment

Models 15, 16, 17, 52 are for Momchil's own entertainment

Model 21 tried to capture motor stuff with a pmod = 1 if subject pressed sick, 0 otherwise

Model 28 is wrong; it has main effect @ trial onset (same as 29) + const @ trial onset; can't have two at the same onset

Model 30 is wrong; it has value pmods @ trial onset (same as 31) but with the const regressor => can't have two at same onset

Model 32 is wrong; it is value pmods @ trial onset + prediction error pmod @ outcome onset (same as 33) but with the const regressor => can't have two at same onset

Model 34 is wrong; M1 (irrelevant) value pmod @ trial onset + PE pmod for M1 only @ outcome onset (same as 37) w the const regressor => can't have two at same onset

Model 35 is wrong; M2 (modulatory) value pmod @ trial onset + PE pmod for M2 only @ outcome onset (same as 38) w the const regressor => can't have two at same onset

Model 36 is wrong; M3 (additive) value pmod @ trial onset + PE pmod for M3 only @ outcome onset (same as 39) w the const regressor => can't have two at same onset
