1) cd itis
2) run gen_itis.sh or something like that to generate itis for all subjects
  they should all be generated in the par subdirectory
3) run parse_itis.py to generate the entire stimulus sequence for all runs for all subjects 
  they should all be generated in the csv subdirectory
4) cd ..
5) run fmri.psyexp
  the participant should be like: con001, con002, con003, etc
  it uses this to pick the generated sequence from itis/csv/...
