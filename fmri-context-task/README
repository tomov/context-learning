1) cd itis
2) run gen_itis.sh or something like that to generate itis for all subjects using optseq2
  they should all be generated in the par/ subdirectory
3) run parse_itis.py to generate the entire stimulus sequence for all runs for all subjects based on the optseq2 iti's
  they should all be generated in the csv/ subdirectory and have the form e.g. con001_run0_itis.csv
  python parse_itis.py -p   # for practice rounds
4) cd ..
5) run fmri.psyexp in psychopy
  the participant should be like: con001, con002, con003, etc
  it uses this to pick the generated sequence from itis/csv/... 
  btw on each round:
    a) on test laptop, get to "Beginning round #XX" screen
    b) on fMRI console, drag and double click the next scan sequence
        on the first one, make sure the brain is in the yellow box -- adjust as needed
        on subsequent ones, DON'T MOVE IT
    c) on fMRI console, hit Apply (the green tick)
    d) on test laptop, hit space to get to the "Waiting for scanner..." screen
    e) on fMRI console, wait for dialog box on console and hit Continue

  if something fucks up and you need to restart experiment e.g. from round #4 (including round #4),
    a) clicks the 'runs' loop
    b) set 'Selected rows' to 'range(3,9)' NOTE: here it is 0-based! So round #4 is 3 here
    c) start the experiment as per the uje
    Note it will say "Beginning round #1" but in reality it will start round 4 (compare with e.g. con004_run3_itis.csv to make sure the stimuli correspond)
6) once the experiment is over, copy the resulting csv file from data/ (e.g. con001_blabla.csv) into the snippets/ directory
7) cd snippets
8) run parse.py to parse the data file into a format that is suitable for analysis into output file fmri.csv
    python parse.py con001_blabla.csv fmri.csv       #  for the first subject
    python parse.py con002_blabla.csv fmri.csv -a    #  for the subsequent subjects -- this appends to the fmri.csv file
9) cd .. ; cd ..
10) cp fmri-context-task/snippets/fmri.csv model/fmri.csv
11) cd model/  and open MATLAB and run analyze_gui2.m from there
