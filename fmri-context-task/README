1) cd itis
2) run gen_itis.sh or something like that to generate itis for all subjects
  they should all be generated in the par/ subdirectory
3) run parse_itis.py to generate the entire stimulus sequence for all runs for all subjects 
  they should all be generated in the csv/ subdirectory and have the form e.g. con001_run0_itis.csv
  python parse_itis.py -p   # for practice rounds
4) cd ..
5) run fmri.psyexp in psychopy
  the participant should be like: con001, con002, con003, etc
  it uses this to pick the generated sequence from itis/csv/... 
  btw on each round:
    a) get to "Beginning round #XX" screen
    b) drag and double click the next scan sequence on the console
        on the first one, make sure the brain is in the yellow box -- adjust as needed
        on subsequent ones, DON'T MOVE IT
    c) hit Apply (the green tick) on console
    d) hit space to get to the "Waiting for scanner..." screen
    e) wait for dialog box on console and hit Continue
6) once the experiment is over, copy the resulting csv file from data/ (e.g. con001_blabla.csv) into the snippets/ directory
7) cd snippets
8) run parse.py to parse the data file into a format that is suitable for analysis into output file fmri.csv
    python parse.py con001_blabla.csv fmri.csv       #  for the first subject
    python parse.py con002_blabla.csv fmri.csv -a    #  for the subsequent subjects -- this appends to the fmri.csv file
9) cd .. ; cd ..
10) cp fmri-context-task/snippets/fmri.csv model/fmri.csv
11) cd model/  and open MATLAB and run analyze_gui2.m from there
